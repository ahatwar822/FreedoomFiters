            <p>Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi (pronunciation (help·info); 19 November 1828 — 18 June 1858),[1][2] was an Indian queen, the Maharani consort of the Maratha princely state of Jhansi from 1843 to 1853 as the wife of Maharaja Gangadhar Rao.[3] She was one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and became a symbol of resistance to the British Rule In India for Indian nationalists.</p>           
            <p>Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828[4][5] (some sources say 1835)[2][6][7] in the town of Varanasi into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family.[8] She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.[9] Her father was Moropant Tambe[10] and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra.[11] Her mother died when she was four years old. Her father was the Commander of the war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district.[12] The Peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "beautiful " and "lively and cheerful". She was educated at home and was taught to read and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included shooting, horsemanship, fencing[13][14] and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tantia Tope.[15][16][dubious – discuss] Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's society at this time.[17] And she was known for her unique perspectives and her courage to fight against social norms even in front of the whole society.</p>
            <p>Rani Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by escorts between the palace and the temple, although sometimes she was carried in a palanquin.[18] Her horses included Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal; according to historians she rode Baadal when escaping from the fort in 1858. Her palace, the Rani Mahal, has now been converted into a museum. It houses a collection of archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th centuries AD.</p>
