            <p>Kasturbai Mohandas Gandhi (listen (help·info), born Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia; 11 April 1869 – 22 February 1944) was an Indian political activist. She married Mohandas Gandhi, more commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, in 1883. With her husband and her eldest son, Harilal, she was involved in the Indian independence movement in British India. National Safe Motherhood Day is observed on April 11 every year in India, coinciding with Kasturbai Gandhi's birthday.[1] Mohandas affectionately called her Baa and in letters referred to her as Mrs. Gandhi</p>           
            <p>Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia was born on 11 April 1869 to Gokuladas Kapadia and Vrajkunwerba Kapadia. The family belonged to the Modh Bania caste of Gujarati Hindu tradesmen and were based in the coastal town of Porbandar.[2] Little is known of Katsurbai's early life. In May 1883, 14-year-old Kasturbai was married to 13-year-old Mohandas in a marriage arranged by their parents, arranged marriage being commonplace and traditional in India.[3] They were married for a total of sixty-two years.</p>
            <p>Recalling the day of their marriage, her husband once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives."[citation needed] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend the first few years of marriage at her parents' house, and away from her husband.[5][failed verification] Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, "even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me."[6] At the beginning of their marriage, Mohandas was also possessive and manipulative; he wanted the ideal wife who would follow his command.</p>
            <p>Later on, in 1906, Mohandas took a vow of chastity, or brahamacharya.[4] Some reports indicated that Katsurbai felt that this opposed her role as a traditional Hindu wife.[4] However, Gandhi quickly defended her marriage when a woman suggested she was unhappy.[7] Gandhi's relatives also insisted that the greatest good was to remain and obey her husband, the Mahatma.[4]</p>
