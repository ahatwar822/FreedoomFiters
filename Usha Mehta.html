The broadcast was transmitted from a secret location in Mumbai and reached listeners all over India. Usha Mehta herself was the main announcer and editor of the broadcast.</p>
            <p>The "Congress Radio" broadcast was a powerful tool in India's struggle for independence. It provided a voice to the people who were unable to express their views openly due to strict British censorship laws.

After India gained independence in 1947, she continued to work for social and political change in India.

                <p>Usha Mehta was also a prominent social activist and worked tirelessly for the betterment of women and children in India. She was the founder of the Mahila Dakshata Samiti, an organization that worked for women's rights and empowerment.

                    In recognition of her contribution to the independence movement and her work for social justice, Usha Mehta was awarded several honors and awards. She was awarded the Padma Shri, one of the highest civilian awards in India, in 1976. She was also awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1986.</p>
            <p>Usha Mehta passed away on August 11, 2000, at the age of 80. Her contribution to India's independence movement and her work for social justice continue to inspire people to this day.

                In conclusion, Usha Mehta was a remarkable woman who dedicated her life to the cause of India's independence and worked tirelessly for social justice and equality. Her contribution to India's freedom struggle through the "Congress Radio" broadcast was a testament to her courage and determination. Her work for women's rights and empowerment continues to inspire people to this day. Usha Mehta will always be remembered as a true patriot and a champion of social justice.</p>
