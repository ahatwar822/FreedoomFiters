            <p>Savitribai Phule was an Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra. Along with her husband, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule[3] in Maharashtra, she played an important and vital role in improving women's rights in India. She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist movement. Savitribai and her husband founded one of the early modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhide wada in 1848. Robert May of the London Missionary Society was the first person to open a school exclusively for girls[4] in the region of Chinsurah, Bengal, in 1818. She worked to abolish the discrimination and unfair treatment of people based on caste and gender.</p>           
            <p>Savitribai and Jyotirao had no children of their own.[16][9] It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. However, there is no original evidence available yet to support this.[10] It is said when Yashwant was about to get married, no one was willing to give him a girl because he was born to a widow. Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization's worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February 1889</p>
            <p>Savitribai was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Jyotirao educated Savitribai and Sagunabai Shirsagar, his cousin sister at their home along with working at their farm.[6][12] After completing her primary education with Jyotirao, her further education was the responsibility of his friends, Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar.[13][additional citation(s) needed]She also enrolled herself in two teacher's training programs; the first was at institution run by an American missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar, and the second course was at a Normal School in Pune.[5][6][12] Given her training, Savitribai may have been the first Indian woman teacher and headmistress.</p>
            <p>Savitribai and her adopted son, Yashwant, opened a clinic to treat those affected by the worldwide Third Pandemic of the bubonic plague when it appeared in the area around Nalasopara in 1897.[17] The clinic was established at stern outskirts of Pune, in an area free of infection. Savitribai died a heroic death trying to save the son of Pandurang Babaji Gaekwad. Upon learning that Gaekwad's son had contracted the Plague in the Mahar settlement outside of Mundhwa, Savitribai Phule rushed to his side and carried him on her back to the hospital. In the process, Savitribai Phule caught the Plague and died at 9:00pm on 10 March 1897.[</p>
